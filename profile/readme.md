# Mediah
## A new way to share files

Mediah is a completely free file sharing platform that utilises Discord to store and host files indefinitely.

## Features

- Upload a file of any size entirely in your browser.
- Share files with friends with sharing links.
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive. (COMING SOON)
- Download files on demand.

## Getting Started

Mediah can run in a variety of locations and ways. For casual users, we recomnend using the [official Mediah website] (https://mediah. vercel. app). 

However, for more experienced users, we offer an open source local memory -friendly web app version of Mediah. You can find installation instructions for that [here] (https://example. com)
